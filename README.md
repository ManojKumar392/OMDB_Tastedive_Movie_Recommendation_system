# OMDB_Tastedrive_Movie_Recommendation_system
This project uses two Apis of different website to recommend movie based on a input. 
The websites of which API is used are OMDB and Tastedrive.
OMBD holds the data of the movie whereas Tastedrive acts as a recommendation engine.
requests_with_caching is the user defined ( in the case the course instructor - defined) module which aids in fetching the response from the API.
